# React Stores Lab

## Objectives

1. Practice using stores to keep state
2. Describe how stores and actions interact
3. Describe how components and stores interact
4. Describe how the user interacts with components

## Overview

Emphasize storing data in stores, updating it via actions, and subscribing to
changes via components.

The tricky thing here will be keeping the emphasis on the store and helping
students avoid concerns in actions etc. We want to try to make these patterns
automatic for students as they continue to practice them.
